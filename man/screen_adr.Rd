\arguments{
\item{.data, }{An \code{adr} data.table. See \code{\link{adr_}}}

\item{meddra}{A \code{meddra} data.table. See \code{\link{meddra_}}}

\item{term_level}{A character string specifying the
MedDRA hierarchy level. Must be one
of \code{"soc"}, \code{"hlgt"}, \code{"hlt"}, \code{"pt"}, or \code{"llt"}.}

\item{freq_threshold}{A numeric value indicating
the minimum frequency (as a proportion) of cases
where a term must appear to be included in the results.
For example, \code{0.05} means 5\%. Defaults to \code{NULL},
meaning no threshold is applied unless \code{top_n}
is different from \code{NULL}.}

\item{top_n}{An integer specifying the number of most
frequently occurring terms to return.
Defaults to \code{NULL}. Overrides \code{freq_threshold} if both are provided.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{term}: The MedDRA term at the specified hierarchy level.
\item \strong{n}: The number of unique reports (cases) where
the term appears.
\item \strong{percentage}: The percentage of total unique reports
where the term appears.
}
The results are sorted in descending order of \code{percentage}.

\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}
Identify and rank the
most frequently reported adverse drug reaction (ADR) terms
in a dataset, based on a specified MedDRA term level.
It allows users to filter terms by a frequency
threshold or extract the top \code{n} most frequently occurring terms.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item If \code{freq_threshold} is set (e.g., \code{0.05}), the function
filters ADR terms appearing in at least 5\% of unique reports in \code{.data}.
\item If \code{top_n} is specified, only the most frequent \code{n} terms
are returned. If both \code{freq_threshold} and \code{top_n} are provided,
only \code{top_n} is applied (a warning is issued in such cases).
\item Counts are computed at the \emph{case} level, not the ADR level.
This means frequencies reflect the proportion of unique
reports (cases) where a term is mentioned,
rather than the total mentions across all reports.
}

The function processes an ADR dataset (\code{adr_}) and
a MedDRA dataset (\code{meddra_}) to generate results
that are linked to a specific MedDRA hierarchy
level (\code{soc}, \code{hlgt}, \code{hlt}, \code{pt}, or \code{llt}).
